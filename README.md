### 🚀 Hello there! I'm Chris, your go-to guy for all things code. 🧑‍💻

### 🌟 About Me:
As a full-time software engineer with a first-class degree under my belt and 4 years of professional experience, I craft solutions that are not just effective but also sleek and smooth - just like a perfectly poured pint! 🍺 Living in the UK, I juggle my time between coding masterpieces and living life to its fullest.

### 👨‍💻 Professional Wizardry:
My day-to-day involves unraveling the mysteries of code, fixing bugs like a pro, and developing solutions that make clients smile. When I'm not in my coding zone, you can find me freelancing, where I bring ideas to life with clean, high-quality code that speaks for itself.

### 🏖️ Life Beyond Code:
When the screens are off, I'm probably soaking up the sun at the beach, exploring the local pubs, or planning my next tattoo. I'm an investment enthusiast, a fitness buff, and a social butterfly who loves meeting new people and sharing stories.

### 💼 Let's Collaborate:
Looking for someone to turn your vision into reality? Need a bug-hunting hero? I'm your guy! Let's connect and create something amazing together.

### "Code, Pub, and Sun - In that order!" - That's my motto. 😎
